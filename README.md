# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

This is my final project for Computer Science.  
It is a Tic-Tac-Toe game made in Python using Tkinter.

## How to Run

1. Install Python.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. Open the file **tictactoe.py**.
4. Press **Run** in VS Code to start the game.

Tkinter is included with Python, so nothing else needs to be installed.
